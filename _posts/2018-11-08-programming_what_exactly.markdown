Remember Myspace? The era of top 8 friends, over editing your photos, choosing a song to play when someone was on your page, and spending soooo much time perfecting your ugly layout and creative bio? That's where it all began for me. I was determined to have the best aesthetic and most creative "about me" section. Enter the most basic HTML/CSS. That's where I first learned how to control the appearance of a webpage and edit its text. Yes, you read that correctly. I learned the basics of HTML on Myspace folks. 

While I did not enter the realm of programming until last month, I can say I have been "interested" in the field for years. I just never took the time to understand everything that goes into it aside from learning how a webpage works and how to edit it. I was so determined to become a graphic designer, that I never delved into the realm of the "front-end" and "back-end", let alone consiously thought it existed back then.

My journey of realizing where I want to take my "creative" career has been filled with the most twists and turns. In this particular order, I wanted to be a: writer, art director, creative director, agency owner, graphic designer, and now finally a developer/programmer. Paving my own road to get to where I want to be is already hard enough, but changing my mind constantly is an even harder. As a self taught, mid-level graphic designer, I realized that I needed to be challenged in my career more, while still operating in a field that I am passionate about. Although I can't say graphic design is boring in any way, I CAN say that I have become "bored" with it because it is something that just comes so easy to me. 

I stepped into the realm of programming to be challenged, think differently, learn something new, and make a career out of it because it's what I enjoy. When I told my family I was learning how to code and wanted to become a programmer, I would get the breif pause followed by, "programming what exactly?". The real asnwer is, I honestly don't know what I will be creating and developing or what problems I will be solving on this journey. I am starting off as a beginner who has no idea what she is getting herself into, but am so open to the process and ready to take this new experience head on. I'm ready for a career change and am positive that this is for me. 

I chose to enroll in a program that will open the door into the programming world by teaching and providing resources for me to get to where I want to be. I have no doubt that I made a great decision and I get excited on a daily basis just thinking about what I will learn and can do.
